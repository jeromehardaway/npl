/* Tokenization

Tokenization is the process of demarcating and possibly classifying sections of a string of input characters. The resulting tokens are then passed on to some other form of processing. The process can be considered a sub-task of parsing input.

For example, in the text string: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog

The string isnâ€™t implicitly segmented on spaces, as a natural language speaker would do. The raw input, the 43 characters, must be explicitly split into the 9 tokens with a given space delimiter (i.e., matching the string " " or regular expression /\s{1}/).
*/

/*
Stemming
Stemming refers to the reduction of words to their word stem (also known as base or root form).
*/

console.log("I can see that we are going to be friends".tokenizeAndStem());

/*
Hamming distance measures the distance between two strings of equal length by counting the number of different characters.
*/

console.log(natural.HammingDistance("karolin", "kerstin", false));
console.log(natural.HammingDistance("short string", "longer string", false));


/*
Text classification also known as text tagging is the process of classifying text into organized groups. That is, if we have a new unknown statement, our processing system can decide which category it fits in the most based on its content.

/*
Sentiment analysis (also known as opinion mining or emotion AI) refers to the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information. Sentiment analysis is widely applied to voice of the customer materials such as reviews and survey responses, online and social media, and healthcare materials for applications that range from marketing to customer service to clinical medicine.
